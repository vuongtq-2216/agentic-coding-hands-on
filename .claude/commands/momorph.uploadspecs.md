## CONTEXT

You are a UI specification expert. Convert spec documents (Markdown/CSV) into standardized CSV format and upload to MoMorph. The generated spec must be understandable by all team members (PO, PM, BrSE, Dev, QA) and precise enough to implement and test.

# OBJECTIVE
Analyze the provided Markdown text from a specific file path, create a specification in ${targetLanguage} that strictly reflects ONLY the provided text, and upload the result to MoMorph. 

# REQUIRED INPUTS
To perform this task, you MUST receive the following from the user:

**Required:**
1. `input_file_path`: The absolute or relative path to the Markdown specification document.

**Optional:**
- `screenId`: The screen ID. If not provided, the agent will prompt the user to either supply it or create a new screen.
- `screen-name`: The descriptive name of the screen. Required only when creating a new screen (no `screenId` provided).
- Custom instructions.
- Target output language preference (`targetLanguage`). Defaults to English if not specified.

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### PRE-FLIGHT CHECK: VALIDATE INPUTS
**CRITICAL RULE:** Before executing any file reading or processing, you MUST verify that the user has provided the required input (`input_file_path`).
- **If `input_file_path` is missing:** **STOP IMMEDIATELY**. Do not proceed. Reply to the user and explicitly ask them to provide it.
- **If `screenId` is provided:** Skip Step 1 and proceed directly to Step 2.
- **If `screenId` is NOT provided:** Proceed to Step 1 to resolve the screen ID.

### CRITICAL RULE: NO HALLUCINATION
You MUST utilize **ONLY** the information explicitly written in the provided Markdown file.
- If a field's information (like itemType, dataType, format, validationNote, maxLength, etc.) is **NOT** mentioned in the Markdown text, you MUST leave that field **EMPTY** (`""`).
- **DO NOT** guess, infer, or hallucinate business logic, maximum lengths, item types, or database tables.
- For every field left empty due to missing information, you MUST generate a corresponding question in the **Candidate QA** column.

### STEP 1: RESOLVE SCREEN ID (only when `screenId` is not provided)

**Goal**
Determine the screenId to use for uploading specs. Either the user provides an existing screenId, or a new screen is created.

**Action**

1) **Prompt the user with two options:**
   Present the following choices (in the user's language):
   - Option 1: The user will provide an existing screenID.
   - Option 2: Create a new screen and upload the spec to it.

   Also include a tip explaining how to obtain a screenID:
   - Right-click a frame in the MoMorph extension → select **MoMorph: Copy Frame Information**.
   - Copy from a MoMorph web URL: `https://momorph.com/files/{fileKey}/screenid/{screenID}`.
   - Or paste the full MoMorph URL directly — the agent will extract the screenID automatically.

2) **Handle user choice**

   **Option 1 — User provides screenId:**
   - The user may provide:
     - A raw `screenId` value.
     - A MoMorph URL (e.g., `https://momorph.com/files/{fileKey}/screenid/{screenID}`). In this case, extract the `screenId` from the URL path.
   - Set `screenId` = extracted or user-provided value.

   **Option 2 — Create new screen:**
   - If `screen-name` is not yet provided, ask the user for it.
   - Call `momorph/create_frame(screen-name)` to create a new screen.
   - From the tool response, extract and set `screenId`.

3) **Proceed** to Step 2 with the resolved `screenId`.

---

### STEP 2: CONVERT SPEC TO CSV (VIA SUB-AGENT)

**Goal**
Delegate the CSV conversion to a dedicated sub-agent using the **best available model** to ensure maximum accuracy in parsing and CSV generation.

**Action**

1) **Construct the sub-agent prompt**
   Build a prompt for the sub-agent that includes:
   - The **entire CSV CONVERSION INSTRUCTIONS section** below (Phase A through Phase C) — copy it in full.
   - The resolved variables:
     - `input_file_path` = `{user-provided path}`
     - `screenId` = `{user-provided screenId}`
     - `screen-name` = `{user-provided screen-name}`
     - `resolved-frame-id` = `{resolved in Step 1}`
     - `resolved-frame-name` = `{resolved in Step 1}`
     - `targetLanguage` = `{user-provided or default English}`
   - The output file path: `/.momorph/specs/{screenId}-{screen-name}.csv`

2) **Call the sub-agent**
   - Use `agent/runSubagent` and explicitly request the **most capable / best model** available.
   <!-- agent:copilot -->
   When calling `runSubagent`, set `modelFamily` to the most capable model available (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4` / `o4-mini` or higher).
   <!-- /agent:copilot -->
   - Pass the full CSV CONVERSION INSTRUCTIONS as the sub-agent's task.
   - The sub-agent will: read the input file → parse items → analyze & map fields → generate the final CSV file.

3) **Verify output**
   - Confirm the CSV file was created at the expected output path: `/.momorph/specs/{screenId}-{screen-name}.csv`.
   - If the sub-agent failed or the file was not created, report the error and **stop**.

4) **Proceed** to Step 3.

---

## CSV CONVERSION INSTRUCTIONS (FOR SUB-AGENT)

> **The following instructions are included in the sub-agent prompt. The sub-agent executes Phase A → Phase B → Phase C sequentially.**

### PHASE A: PARSE THE MARKDOWN INPUT

**Goal**
Read and structure the provided Markdown text from the given file path into a list of items to be processed.

**Action**
1) Use the appropriate tool to read the content of the file located at the provided `input_file_path`.
2) Scan the Markdown document and identify all UI items. They are typically formatted as bullet points or headers (e.g., `* **1.1. Back Button**`).
3) For each item, extract the exact text for:
   - **Item ID / No**: (e.g., `1.1`)
   - **Item Name**: (e.g., `Back Button`)
   - **Description Section**: (e.g., text under "Mô tả")
   - **Action/Navigation Section**: (e.g., text under "Điều hướng / Xử lý")

---

### PHASE B: ANALYZE ITEMS AND MAP FIELDS

**Goal**
Map the extracted text directly to the required CSV fields. Strictly enforce the "No Hallucination" rule.

**Action**
For each extracted item, determine the following fields. Translate the content into `${targetLanguage}` if necessary, while keeping the exact original meaning.

1. **Naming**:
   - `No`: The item number from the Markdown (e.g., "1.1").
   - `itemId`: Specific node/system ID if explicitly provided in the markdown (e.g., a design item node ID, system identifier, or any explicit ID annotation). If NOT provided, leave **EMPTY**.
   - `itemName`: The name of the item from the Markdown.
   - `nameJP` (Japanese):
     - If the item has no meaningful text → generate a short Japanese name describing the item.
     - If the visible text is Japanese → use or adapt it as a good Japanese name.
     - If visible text is not Japanese → translate to a concise Japanese name.
   - `nameTrans` (English):
     - If the item has no text → generate a short English name based on `nameJP` and the role of the item.
     - If visible text is already English → keep or lightly normalize it.
     - If visible text is not English → translate into English.

2. **Types & Data (itemType, itemSubtype, buttonType, dataType, format)**:
   - Search the Markdown description for explicit keywords (e.g., "Nút / Button", "Checkbox", "Dropdown", "Text input").
   - If found, map to the correct type (e.g., `itemType = "button"`).
   - If NOT explicitly clear from the text, leave these fields **EMPTY**.

3. **Constraints (required, minLength, maxLength, defaultValue)**:
   - Search the Markdown text for constraints (e.g., "Tối đa 255 ký tự", "Bắt buộc nhập", "Mặc định...").
   - Map explicitly mentioned constraints.
   - If NOT mentioned, leave **EMPTY**. Do NOT use heuristics or standard web defaults.

4. **User Action & Navigation**:
   - `transitionNote`: Extract the exact text from the "Điều hướng / Xử lý" (Action/Navigation) section. Translate to `${targetLanguage}`.
   - `userAction`: If the text explicitly says "Click", "Hover", etc., map it to `on_click`, `while_hovering`, etc. Otherwise, leave empty.

5. **ValidationNote**:
   - Extract any explicit error states or conditional logic mentioned in the Markdown.
   - If none are mentioned, leave **EMPTY**.

6. **Description**:
   - Extract the exact text from the "Mô tả" (Description) section. Translate to `${targetLanguage}`.

7. **Database Mapping**:
   - Leave `databaseTable`, `databaseColumn`, and `databaseNote` **EMPTY** unless explicitly stated in the Markdown.

8. **Candidate QA (missing information checklist)**:
   - Check the fields you mapped. For any critical field that was left empty because the Markdown lacked info (e.g., `itemType` is unknown, `maxLength` is missing for an input, `validationNote` is missing for a form field), create a bulleted QA entry.
   - **Format:**
     - `- [Field Name] is missing. What should be the value for this item?`
   - **CSV Safety Rules for QA:**
     - QA must not use commas at the beginning of lines.
     - QA must not include semicolons as separators.
     - QA must be emitted as a single contiguous text block using real newline characters.
     - Bullet points must start with `- ` only.

**Output of Phase B**
Keep the analyzed data in memory or write to a temporary Markdown file (`items_analysis.md`) structured identically to Phase B output requirements before proceeding to Phase C.

---

### PHASE C: MERGE RESULTS & GENERATE FINAL CSV (STRICT FORMATTING)

**Goal**
Aggregate all analysis files and convert them into a **valid, Excel-compatible CSV** file.
To prevent broken cells and split rows, you must strictly follow the **Algorithmic Field Processing** below for **every single cell**.

**Input**
- `items_analysis.md` OR multiple `items_analysis_part_*.md` files.

**Action**

1) **Merge Analysis Files**
   - Check if `items_analysis_part_*.md` files exist in the folder.
   - **If Batch Files Exist (Subagent Mode):**
     - Read all `items_analysis_part_*.md` files.
     - Extract all "Item" blocks from all files.
     - Combine them into a single list of items, sorted by `No`.
   - **If Only Single File Exists (Single Agent Mode):**
     - Read `items_analysis.md`.

2) **Generate CSV Content**

   ## A) DEFINITIONS

   1. **Header Columns (Exactly 22 columns) - MUST BE IN ENGLISH:**
      `"No","itemId","itemName","nameJP","nameTrans","itemType","itemSubtype","buttonType","dataType","required","format","minLength","maxLength","defaultValue","validationNote","description","userAction","transitionNote","databaseTable","databaseColumn","databaseNote","qa"`

      **CRITICAL: CSV headers must ALWAYS remain in English exactly as shown above. NEVER translate header names to any other language.**

   ## B) ALGORITHMIC FIELD PROCESSING (CRITICAL)

   To prevent any column misalignment, you MUST process EVERY SINGLE FIELD (all 22 columns for every row) according to these rules:

   1. **Null / Empty Handling:**
      If the field is empty, missing, or one of (`N/A`, `None`, `null`), it MUST be output as `""`. **DO NOT** leave empty fields as blank spaces between commas (e.g., `,,` is FORBIDDEN. It must be `,"",`).

   2. **Sanitize Delimiters:**
      Replace **ALL** commas `,` inside the text with semicolons `;`.
      *Example:* `Error, try again` → `Error; try again`

   3. **Quote Escaping:**
      Replace all existing double quotes `"` inside the text with double-double quotes `""`.
      *Example:* `Type "A"` → `Type ""A""`

   4. **Mandatory Wrapping:**
      Wrap **EVERY** value (including empty values) in double quotes `"..."`.
      *Example:* `text_form` → `"text_form"`
      *Example (empty):* `` → `""`
      *Example (multiline):* 
      `Line 1`
      `Line 2` 
      → `"Line 1`
      `Line 2"`

   ## C) ROW CONSTRUCTION

   1. **Write Header:**
      Write the exact header row provided in Section A.
   
   2. **Write Data Rows:**
      For each item:
      - You MUST generate exactly **22 quoted strings** (from "No" to "qa").
      - Join them with exactly **21 commas**.
      - Do NOT put spaces around the commas.
      - Use **real newlines** for line breaks inside the CSV content.

**Output File Content Example:**

```csv
"No","itemId","itemName","nameJP","nameTrans","itemType","itemSubtype","buttonType","dataType","required","format","minLength","maxLength","defaultValue","validationNote","description","userAction","transitionNote","databaseTable","databaseColumn","databaseNote","qa"
"1.1","","Back Button","戻るボタン","Back Button","button","","","","","","","","","","Nút quay lại trang trước.","on_click","Click để điều hướng về màn PLG_0801 Screen Detail.","","","",""
"1.2","","Generate Item list Button","アイテムリスト生成ボタン","Generate Item List Button","button","","","","","","","","","","Nút mở modal cài đặt...","on_click","Mở modal cài đặt...","","","",""
```

**Output (file)**
- Save to: `/.momorph/specs/{screenId}-{screen-name}.csv`. Create directories if they do not exist. If output file already exists, overwrite it.
- **Do NOT** wrap the file content in markdown code blocks (like ```csv). Write raw CSV data directly to the file.

### STEP 3: UPLOAD SPECS TO MOMORPH

**Goal**
Upload the generated CSV spec file to MoMorph. Try MCP tool first; fall back to CLI if MCP is unavailable or fails.

**Action**

#### OPTION A: MCP TOOL (PREFERRED)

1) **Upload via MCP tool**
   - Call `momorph/upload_specs` with the following parameters:
     - `screenId`: `{screenId}`
     - `csvFilePath`: `./.momorph/specs/{screenId}-{screen-name}.csv`

2) **Check result**
   - If the MCP tool succeeds: Report success to the user and **stop**.
   - If the MCP tool fails or is not available: Proceed to **Option B**.

#### OPTION B: CLI FALLBACK

1) **Construct the upload command**
   Using the resolved `resolved-frame-id` and `resolved-frame-name` from Step 1, and the CSV file path from Phase C, run the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   momorph upload specs ./.momorph/specs/{screenId}-{screen-name}.csv \
     --screen-id {screenId} \
     --frame-id {resolved-frame-id} \
     --frame-name '{resolved-frame-name}'
   ```

2) **Execute the command**
   - Use `execute/runInTerminal` to run the upload command.
   - Monitor the terminal output for success or error messages.

3) **Report result**
   - If upload succeeds: Inform the user that the specs have been uploaded successfully.
   - If upload fails: Display the error message and suggest corrective actions.
